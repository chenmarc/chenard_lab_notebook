In this exercise, we create a simple scroll-based animation using vanilla JavaScript. By the end, when you scroll down the page, sections shouldfade in subtly when they enter/intersct the viewport. The goal is to explore the idea of checking element positions and dynamically adding CSS classes for transitions.

Use the starter file `00-scroll-animation.js` to implement the logic. The comments will indicate where you should add your code. The HTML structure is provided in `scroll-start.html` for reference, and you will need to modify the <section> tags to add the appropriate classes (look in 00-scroll.css for which class to add)

### Objectives
- Detect the user's scroll position.
- Check if elements are within the viewport.
- add CSS classes to trigger fade-in animations.

- The animation should use CSS transitions for opacity 
- tip: use liveserver to check whether or not the animations work or not as you modify the files!
